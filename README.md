# Threat_SpatialCueing

The aim of this project is to explore the effect of a threat induction (Threat of screams paradigm) on attentional processings. Specifically, we want to replicate the results of Normand et al., (2014) of a reinforcement of the contingent attentional capture using the Threat of Screams paradigm instead of a self-evaluativ threat.
